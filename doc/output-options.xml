     This chapter is dedicated to the description of the different
     output modules that can be inserted into the output tree. Each of
     these modules will be defined by a general description of its purpose
     and its mode of operations, a table of the configuration options it
     will display in job options window (if any), 
     and a table of the configuration
     options it will display in the job status window (if any).</para>

      <refsection><title>Synopsis</title>
        <para>The localizations file module stores received localizations
            in an ASCII text file. This text file is line-based with one line
            per localization and one line header information. Both the header 
            line and localization lines consist of at least 4 space-delimited
            fields. For the localizations, the fields denote X and Y position
            in pixels, the image number of the localization and the strength
            of the localization (Gaussian fit amplitude) in camera A/D counts.
            The header consists of the maximum allowed X/Y coordinates and
            image number and of a 0 for the amplitude.</para>
        <para>More fields may be present, but will not be documented.
            Forward compatibility can be achieved by ignoring all but the first
            four fields.</para>

            <para>The image display module displays all received localizations in
            an image and optionally saves this image to a file.</para>

            <title>Image construction algorithm</title>
            <para>The image construction is performed with the algorithm documented
                in <xref linkend="WolterDiplomarbeit"/>. Summarizing this algorithm,
                a localization density map is constructed by linearly interpolating
                and accumulating the localizations, weighted by their amplitude,
                on a pixel lattice.
                This density map is discretized with a very high depth to generate
                a high dynamic range image; this high-dynamic range image is reduced
                to a displayable range via weighted histogram equalization.</para>
            <para>The histogram equalization operation modifies the absolute
                brightness differences between image areas to optimize contrast.
                This means that a pixel in the result image with a brightness of
                200 did not necessarily receive twice as many localizations as a
                pixel with brightness 100 did. Histogram equalizations guarantees
                only that a brighter pixel represents at least as many localizations
                as a weaker pixel.</para>
            <para>You can change the extent to which histogram equalization is
                performed by changing the histogram equalization power between
                0 and 1. 0 means no histogram equalization, and pixel values are
                linear with localization density. 1 means full equalization: All
                brightness values appear equally often in the image. While images
                without histogram equalization aplied often suffer in contrast due
                to few, very bright pixels suppressing the normal structures, too
                much histogram equalization overemphasises regions with weak signals
                and background noise. The default value for the histogram power is
                usually a good compromise.</para>
        </refsection>
     <refsection id="color_coding">
       <title>Color coding</title>
       <para>Several different coloring schemes are available for the
         resulting image. All of these operate on the histogram-normalized
         brightness, but display the brightness in various ways to enhance
         information
         depth, produce a pretty-looking image or give information about the
         time coordinate. All of these color schemes show brighter colors
         to indicate more localizations; to invert this meaning and show,
         for example, black localizations on a white background, use the
         "Invert colours" option.</para>
       <para>The <emphasis>black and white</emphasis> colour scheme is the
         fastest colour code. It displays the equalized brightness directly
         on a scale ranging from black (no localizations) to white (maximum
         amount).</para>
       <para>The <emphasis>black, red, yellow and white</emphasis> colour
         scheme offers a higher dynamic range by displaying the lowest
         third of the brightness values on a scale ranging from black to
         red, the middle third on a scale from red to yellow and the highest
         third on a scale from yellow to white. In total, about 760
         brightness levels are displayed.</para>
       <para>The <emphasis>constant colour</emphasis> colour
         scheme is similar to the black-and-white scheme, but uses an
         arbitray colour instead of white. You can use the "Select colour
         hue" and "Select saturation" to choose the colour.</para>
       <para>The <emphasis>Vary hue by time coordinate</emphasis> colour
         scheme colour-codes each localization by its time coordinate, that
         is, by the number  of the image it occured in. The code starts at
         the
         hue selected in "Select colour hue" and then follows the colour
         circle of the HSV colour model, that is, ranges from red over
         yellow, green, cyan, blue to violet.
         If multiple localizations contribute to the same pixel, hue and
         variance are interpreted as angle and radius on a plane, converted
         to cartesian coordinates, averaged arithmetically and converted
         back to hue and variance.
         For example, if red (hue 0, 
         saturation 1) and yellow-green (hue 0.25, saturation 1) are present
         with amplitudes 1 and 4 on a pixel, they are
         converted to the points (1,0) and (0,1), averaged to (0.2,0.8) and
         transformed back to (hue 0.21, saturation 0.82), which is a slightly
         pale yellow. Observe that a point with localizations equally 
         distributed over a long range of images tends to have a low
         saturation, that is, appear white.</para>
