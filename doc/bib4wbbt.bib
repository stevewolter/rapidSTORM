  abstract = {Localization microscopy techniques based on localizing single fluorophore
	molecules now routinely achieve accuracies better than 30 nm. Unlike
	conventional optical microscopies, localization microscopy experiments
	do not generate an image but a list of discrete coordinates of estimated
	fluorophore positions. Data display and analysis therefore generally
	require visualization methods that translate the position data into
	conventional images. Here we investigate the properties of several
	widely used visualization techniques and show that a commonly used
	algorithm based on rendering Gaussians may lead to a 1.44-fold loss
	of resolution. Existing methods typically do not explicitly take
	sampling considerations into account and thus may produce spurious
	structures. We present two additional visualization algorithms, an
	adaptive histogram method based on quad-trees and a Delaunay triangulation
	based visualization of point data that address some of these deficiencies.
	The new visualization methods are designed to suppress erroneous
	detail in poorly sampled image areas but avoid loss of resolution
	in well-sampled regions. A number of criteria for scoring visualization
	methods are developed as a guide for choosing among visualization
	methods and are used to qualitatively compare various algorithms.},

	super-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenging task. Here,
	we introduce a family of photo-switchable fluorescent probes and

	(STORM). Each probe consists of a photo-switchable "reporter" fluorophore
	that can be cycled between fluorescent and dark states, and an "activator"
	that facilitates photo-activation of the reporter. Combinatorial
	pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes
	with many distinct colors. Iterative, color-specific activation of
	sparse subsets of these probes allows their localization with nanometer
	accuracy, enabling the construction of a super-resolution STORM image.
	Using this approach, we demonstrate multicolor imaging of DNA model
	samples and mammalian cells with 20- to 30-nanometer resolution.
	This technique will facilitate direct visualization of molecular
	interactions at the nanometer scale.},

	of a signal to an accuracy which is substantially less than the actual

	this paper derives theoretical limits on the ability to locate signal
	position. The limiting error in position measurement is shown to
	be a simple function of the instrument resolution, the density of
	sample points, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. An interesting
	conclusion is that position information on a much finer scale than
	the minimum instrument sampling interval is contained in data of
	modest signal-to-noise ratio. The common procedure of excluding the
	portion of the data lying below an amplitude threshold to guard against
	background fluctuations is incorporated in the maximum likelihood
	analysis. It is shown that selection of the optimum amplitude threshold
	level depends on the type of noise present in the data, and can be
	an important factor in position accuracy. The analytical results
	exhibit close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of position
	accuracy in the presence of noise.},

  abstract = {Combining optical tweezers with single molecule fluorescence offers
	a powerful technique to study the biophysical properties of single
	proteins and molecules. However, such integration into a combined,
	coincident arrangement has been severely limited by the dramatic
	reduction in fluorescence longevity of common dyes under simultaneous
	exposure to trapping and fluorescence excitation beams. We present
	a novel approach to overcome this problem by alternately modulating
	the optical trap and excitation beams to prevent simultaneous exposure
	of the fluorescent dye. We demonstrate the dramatic reduction of
	trap-induced photobleaching effects on the common single molecule
	fluorescence dye Cy3, which is highly susceptible to this destructive
	pathway. The extension in characteristic fluorophore longevity, a
	20-fold improvement when compared to simultaneous exposure to both
	beams, prolongs the fluorescence emission to several tens of seconds
	in a combined, coincident arrangement. Furthermore, we show that
	this scheme, interlaced optical force-fluorescence, does not compromise
	the trap stiffness or single molecule fluorescence sensitivity at
	sufficiently high modulation frequencies. Such improvement permits
	the simultaneous measurement of the mechanical state of a system
	with optical tweezers and the localization of molecular changes with
	single molecule fluorescence, as demonstrated by mechanically unzipping
	a 15-basepair DNA segment labeled with Cy3.},

  abstract = {Single particle tracking has seen numerous applications in biophysics,
	ranging from the diffusion of proteins in cell membranes to the movement
	of molecular motors. A plethora of computer algorithms have been
	developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects
	between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have
	"nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison
	of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we
	quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly
	used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference,
	centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects
	ranging in size from point sources to 5 {micro}m were computer generated
	with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and
	the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision.
	We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for
	large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit
	to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms
	of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise.
	Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise
	ratio approaches 4. We judge direct Gaussian fit to be the best algorithm
	when tracking single fluorophores, where the signal-to-noise is frequently
	near 4.},

	enables high-throughput, quantitative analysis of a large number

	where the fluorophore can be switched between a fluorescent state
	and a dark state upon illumination at different wavelengths. The
	photochemical mechanism by which switching occurs has yet to be elucidated.
	In this study, we have determined the mechanism of photoswitching
	by characterizing the kinetics of dark state formation and the spectral
	and structural properties of the dark state. The rate of switching
	to the dark state depends on the concentration of the primary thiol
	in the solution and the solution pH in a manner quantitatively consistent
	with the formation of an encounter complex between the cyanine dye
	and ionized thiol prior to their conjugation. Mass spectrometry suggests
	that the photoconversion product is a thiol-cyanine adduct in which
	covalent attachment of the thiol to the polymethine bridge disrupts
	the original conjugated pi-electron system of the dye.},

	fluorescence microscopy with a tremendous potential for impacting

	developed over the last decade, all capable of overcoming the fundamental
	diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining
	subdiffraction limit optical resolution in all three dimensions.
	This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal
	fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded
	in a sequence of images (movie). We demonstrate a 5-fold improvement
	in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope.
	This resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps,
	which in turn allows the evaluation of images at different resolution
	levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method
	features significant background reduction and thus contrast enhancement
	and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of fibroblast
	cells.},

	dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used as efficient
	reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state
	after apparent photobleaching can be restored at room temperature
	upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching
	and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous solution irradiating first
	at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration
	of absorption and fluorescence strongly depends on efficient oxygen
	removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine.
	Single-molecule fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized
	Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
	alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and
	nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability of >90\%
	at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine
	dyes volunteer as a simple alternative for ultrahigh-density optical
	data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5)

  abstract = {Biological structures span many orders of magnitude in size, but far-field
	visible light microscopy suffers from limited resolution. A new method
	for fluorescence imaging has been developed that can obtain spatial
	distributions of large numbers of fluorescent molecules on length
	scales shorter than the classical diffraction limit. Fluorescence
	photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) analyzes thousands
	of single fluorophores per acquisition, localizing small numbers
	of them at a time, at low excitation intensity. To control the number
	of visible fluorophores in the field of view and ensure that optically
	active molecules are separated by much more than the width of the
	point spread function, photoactivatable fluorescent molecules are
	used, in this case the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein
	(PA-GFP). For these photoactivatable molecules, the activation rate
	is controlled by the activation illumination intensity; nonfluorescent
	inactive molecules are activated by a high-frequency (405-nm) laser
	and are then fluorescent when excited at a lower frequency. The fluorescence
	is imaged by a CCD camera, and then the molecules are either reversibly
	inactivated or irreversibly photobleached to remove them from the
	field of view. The rate of photobleaching is controlled by the intensity
	of the laser used to excite the fluorescence, in this case an Ar+
	ion laser. Because only a small number of molecules are visible at
	a given time, their positions can be determined precisely; with only
	[\~{}]100 detected photons per molecule, the localization precision
	can be as much as 10-fold better than the resolution, depending on
	background levels. Heterogeneities on length scales of the order
	of tens of nanometers are observed by FPALM of PA-GFP on glass. FPALM
	images are compared with images of the same molecules by widefield
	fluorescence. FPALM images of PA-GFP on a terraced sapphire crystal
	surface were compared with atomic force microscopy and show that
	the full width at half-maximum of features [\~{}]86 {+/-} 4 nm is
	significantly better than the expected diffraction-limited optical
	resolution. The number of fluorescent molecules and their brightness
	distribution have also been determined using FPALM. This new method
	suggests a means to address a significant number of biological questions
	that had previously been limited by microscope resolution. 10.1529/biophysj.106.091116},

  abstract = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial
	improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution
	of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional
	(3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge.
	We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)
	by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral
	positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative,
	stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision
	3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D
	image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved
	an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions
	and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development
	allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.

   abstract = {Colocalization of differently labeled biomolecules is a valuable tool in fluorescence microscopy and can provide information on biomolecular interactions. With the advent of super-resolution microscopy, colocalization analysis is getting closer to molecular resolution, bridging the gap to other technologies such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Among these novel microscopic techniques, single-molecule localization-based super-resolution methods offer the advantage of providing single-molecule coordinates that, rather than intensity information, can be used for colocalization analysis. This requires adapting the existing mathematical algorithms for localization microscopy data. Here, we introduce an algorithm for coordinate-based colocalization analysis which is suited for single-molecule super-resolution data. In addition, we present an experimental configuration for simultaneous dual-color imaging together with a robust approach to correct for optical aberrations with an accuracy of a few nanometers. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for cellular structures and for two proteins binding actin filaments.},

  abstract = {Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and related fluorescent
	biological imaging methods are capable of providing very high spatial
	resolutions (up to 20 nm). Two major demands limit its widespread
	use on biological samples: requirements for photoactivatable/photoconvertible
	fluorescent molecules, which are sometimes difficult to incorporate,
	and high background signals from autofluorescence or fluorophores
	in adjacent focal planes in three-dimensional imaging which reduces
	PALM resolution significantly. We present here a high-resolution
	PALM method utilizing conventional EGFP as the photoconvertible fluorophore,
	improved algorithms to deal with high levels of biological background
	noise, and apply this to imaging higher order chromatin structure.
	We found that the emission wavelength of EGFP is efficiently converted
	from green to red when exposed to blue light in the presence of reduced
	riboflavin. The photon yield of red-converted EGFP using riboflavin
	is comparable to other bright photoconvertible fluorescent proteins
	that allow <20 nm resolution. We further found that image pre-processing
	using a combination of denoising and deconvolution of the raw PALM
	images substantially improved the spatial resolution of the reconstruction
	from noisy images. Performing PALM on Drosophila mitotic chromosomes
	labeled with H2AvD-EGFP, a histone H2A variant, revealed filamentous
	components of 70 nm. This is the first observation of fine chromatin
	filaments specific for one histone variant at a resolution approximating
	that of conventional electron microscope images (10-30 nm). As demonstrated
	by modeling and experiments on a challenging specimen, the techniques

Here, we discuss a form of superresolution microscopy based on the controlled activation and sampling of sparse subsets of photoconvertible fluorescent molecules. In this single-molecule-based imaging approach, a wide variety of probes have proved valuable, ranging from genetically encodable photoactivatable fluorescent proteins to photoswitchable cyanine dyes. These have been used in diverse applications of superresolution imaging: from three-dimensional, multicolor molecule localization to tracking of nanometric structures and molecules in living cells. Single-molecule-based superresolution imaging thus offers exciting possibilities for obtaining molecular-scale information on biological events occurring at variable timescales. }

	However, conventional microscopy-based imaging techniques are not

	point source that is imaged using MUM. We validate MUMLA through
	simulated and experimental data and show that the 3D position of
	quantum dots can be determined over a wide spatial range. We demonstrate
	that MUMLA indeed provides the best possible accuracy with which
	the 3D position can be determined. Our analysis shows that MUM overcomes
	the poor depth discrimination of the conventional microscope, and
	thereby paves the way for high accuracy tracking of nanoparticles
	in a live cell environment. Here, using MUM and MUMLA we report for
	the first time the full 3D trajectories of QD-labeled antibody molecules
	undergoing endocytosis in live cells from the plasma membrane to
	the sorting endosome deep inside the cell.},

	such as ultramicroscopy, the laser beam illuminating the specimen
	is truncated by a slit aperture before it is focused to a light sheet
	by a single cylindrical lens. A light sheet generated in this way
	can be made very thin near to the focal point, but unfortunately
	its Rayleigh range is severely limited. This problem can be partially
	solved by using a smaller slit aperture. However, this also causes
	a major loss in power, a severe broadening of the beam waist, and
	thus a significant loss of resolution along the detection axis. We
	developed improved light-sheet-generation optics, which provide longer
	Raleigh ranges, whilst retaining beam waists comparable to our standard
	system with one cylindrical lens. Using the modified system we achieved
	a marked improvement in the resolution of ultramicroscopy reconstructions
	of representative biological specimens. (\copyright 2010 WILEY-VCH

	time periods, the examination of an almost unlimited number of individual

	multiple fluorescent subresolution tags with super-resolution in
	images of living cells. Recently, we described an algorithm for the
	automatic detection of such tags in single frames and demonstrated
	its potential in a biological system. The algorithm presented here
	adds to the tag detector a module for relative tracking of the signals
	between frames. As with tag detection, the main problem in relative
	tracking arises when signals of multiple tags interfere. We propose
	a novel multitemplate matching framework that exploits knowledge
	of the microscope point spread function to separate the intensity
	contribution of each tag in image regions with signal interferences.
	We use this intensity splitting to reconstruct a template for each
	tag in the source frame and a patch in the target frame, which are
	both free of intensity contributions from other tag signals. Tag
	movements between frames are then tracked by seeking, for each template-patch
	pair, the displacement vector providing the best signal match in
	terms of the sum of squared intensity differences. Because template
	and patch generation of tags with overlapping signals are interdependent,
	the matching is carried out simultaneously for all tags, and in an
	iterative manner. We have examined the performance of our approach
	using synthetic 3D data and observed a significant increase in resolution
	and robustness as compared with our previously described detector.
	It is now possible to localize and track tags separated by a distance
	three times smaller than the Rayleigh limit with a relative positional
	accuracy of better than 50 nm. We have applied the new tracking system
	to extract metaphase trajectories of fluorescently tagged chromosomes
	relative to the spindle poles in budding yeast.},

  abstract = {Proteins play a major role for the existence of all living organisms,
	since they are virtually involved in every kind of biological process.
	Unfortunately, the functions and interactions of the vast majority
	of proteins are unknown. The knowledge of these functions could provide
	crucial information for the simulation of cell behaviour, which facilitates
	the investigation of diseases as well as the development of innovative
	drugs and vaccines. There are several techniques dealing with this
	problem. One kind of very promising approaches is subsumed under
	the term location proteomics. It analyses the location of proteins
	in order to derive information about their function. As specific
	cell compartments fulfil specific tasks, a protein under consideration
	is likely to be involved in performing the function of the cell compartments
	it occurs in. But since the locations of proteins depend on the cell
	state and the environmental conditions, they are highly dynamic.
	Therefore, it is beneficial to examine them in living cells. This
	can be realised by means of fluorescence microscopy; the proteins
	in question are tagged by a fluorescent dye and subsequently rendered
	visible using a fluorescence microscope. Even co-localisations and
	temporary interactions of multiple proteins become observable. Therefore,
	location proteomics could reveal crucial details of cell processes.
	But even if tagged proteins can be observed in live cells, their
	analysis is difficult. A fluorescence image typically contains multiple
	or even numerous cells. These cells may be in various states resulting
	in different locations of the tagged proteins. Furthermore, the cells
	themselves are not necessarily visible. Hence, additional information
	is required. This thesis provides image analysis methods that facilitate
	the automatic localisation of proteins in living cells: Firstly,
	a procedure is introduced, which is able to recognise cells in bright-field
	microscope images. Here, the cells are automatically localised based
	on morphological operators and segmented by means of an enhanced
	active contour algorithm. The final segments are evaluated using
	an incremental neural network and support vector machines. This technique
	can be applied in conjunction with protein localisation approaches
	without causing any problems. Secondly, methods allowing the examination
	of protein distribution patterns within the recognised cells are
	discussed. Here, a set of appropriate features was selected, which
	enables a differentiation between ten protein locations. The classification
	is performed by an incremental neural network. So, additional protein
	location patterns and protein locations can be incorporated. Finally,
	both techniques were combined, which resulted in an automated system
	that is amenable to high-throughput processing. Such a system constitutes
	an innovative contribution to the current proteomic research, in
	particular, as incremental approaches are employed, which enable
	the integration of new information during their application.},

  abstract = {The need for optical sectioning in bio-imaging has amongst others
	led to the development of the two-photon scanning microscopy. However,
	this comes with some intrinsic fundamental limitations in the temporal
	domain as the focused spot has to be scanned mechanically in the
	sample plane. Hence for a large number of biological applications
	where imaging speed is a limiting factor, it would be significantly
	advantageous to generate widefield excitations with an optical sectioning
	comparable to the two-photon scanning microscopy. Recently by using
	the technique of temporal focusing it was shown that high axial resolution
	widefield excitation can be generated in picosecond time scales without
	any mechanical moving parts. However the achievable axial resolution
	is still well above that of a two-photon scanning microscope. Here
	we demonstrate a new ultrafast widefield two-photon imaging technique
	termed Multifocal Temporal Focusing (MUTEF) which relies on the generation
	of a set of diffraction limited beams produced by an Echelle grating
	that scan across a second tilted diffraction grating in picosecond
	time scale, generating a widefield excitation area with an axial
	resolution comparable to a two-photon scanning microscope. Using
	this method we have shown widefield two-photon imaging on fixed biological
	samples with an axial sectioning with a FWHM of ~0.85 $\mu$m.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in optical microscopy have enabled biological imaging
	beyond the diffraction limit at nanometer resolution. A general feature
	of most of the techniques based on photoactivated localization microscopy
	(PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has
	been the use of thin biological samples in combination with total
	internal reflection, thus limiting the imaging depth to a fraction
	of an optical wavelength. However, to study whole cells or organelles
	that are typically up to 15 $\textmu$m deep into the cell, the extension
	of these methods to a three-dimensional (3D) super resolution technique
	is required. Here, we report an advance in optical microscopy that
	enables imaging of protein distributions in cells with a lateral
	localization precision better than 50 nm at multiple imaging planes
	deep in biological samples. The approach is based on combining the
	lateral super resolution provided by PALM with two-photon temporal
	focusing that provides optical sectioning. We have generated super-resolution
	images over an axial range of $\approx$ 10 $\textmu$m in both mitochondrially

	Adding or removing reductant or oxidant, switches the fluorescence

	picture of the underlying photoinduced and redox reactions is elaborated.
	In the presence of both reductant and oxidant, continuous switching
	is manifested by "blinking" with independently controllable on- and

abstract = { Super-resolution imaging methods now can provide spatial resolution that is well below the diffraction limit approaching virtually molecular resolution. They can be applied to biological samples and provide new and exciting views on the structural organization of cells and the dynamics of biomolecular assemblies on wide timescales. These revolutionary developments come with novel requirements for fluorescent probes, labeling techniques, and data interpretation strategies. Synthetic fluorophores have a small size, are available in many colors spanning the whole spectrum, and can easily be chemically modified and used for stoichiometric labeling of proteins in live cells. Because of their brightness, their photostability, and their ability to be operated as photoswitchable fluorophores even in living cells under physiological conditions, synthetic fluorophores have the potential to substantially accelerate the broad application of live-cell super-resolution imaging methods. }

We demonstrate the potential of super-resolution detection by tracking fluorescently tagged chromosomes during mitosis in budding yeast. Our biological objective is to identify and analyse the proteins responsible for the generation of tensile force during chromosome segregation. Dynamic measurements in living cells are made possible by green fluroescent protein (GFP)-tagging chromosomes and spindle pole bodies to generate cells carrying four fluorescent spots, and observe the motion of the spots over time using 3D-fluorescence microscopy. The central problem in spot detection arises with the partial or complete overlap of spots when tagged objects are separated by distances below the resolution of the optics. To detect multiple spots under these conditions, a set of candidate mixture models is built, and the best candidate is selected from the set based on 2-statistics of the residuals in least-square fits of the models to the image data.Even with images having a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 510, we are able to increase the resolution two-fold below the Rayleigh limit. In images with a SNR of 510, the accuracy with which isolated tags can be localized is less than 5 nm. For two tags separated by less than the Rayleigh limit, the localization accuracy is found to be between 10 and 20 nm, depending on the effective point-to-point distance. This indicates the intimate relationship between resolution and localization accuracy.},

We accomplish this by simultaneously imaging a focused plane, for in-plane position (x,y), and a defocused plane, for out-of-plane position (z), of a molecule using a single CCD camera. We applied our method to several systems including in vivo melanosome tracking and phagocytosed fluorescent bead tracking. We have achieved 25 nm accuracy with a 250 ms time resolution. }

   abstract = {Localisation microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by measuring the position of individual molecules to obtain optical images with a lateral resolution better than 30 nm. Single molecule localisation microscopy was originally demonstrated only in two dimensions but has recently been extended to three dimensions. Here we develop a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) localisation microscopy by engineering of the point-spread function (PSF) of a fluorescence microscope. By introducing a linear phase gradient between the two halves of the objective pupil plane the PSF is split into two lateral lobes whose relative position depends on defocus. Calculations suggested that the phase gradient resulting from the very small tolerances in parallelism of conventional slides made from float glass would be sufficient to generate a two-lobed PSF. We demonstrate that insertion of a suitably chosen microscope slide that occupies half the objective aperture combined with a novel fast fitting algorithm for 3D localisation estimation allows nanoscopic imaging with detail resolution well below 100 nm in all three dimensions (standard deviations of 20, 16, and 42 nm in x, y , and z directions, respectively). The utility of the approach is shown by imaging the complex 3D distribution of microtubules in cardiac muscle cells that were stained with conventional near infrared fluorochromes. The straightforward optical setup, minimal hardware requirements and large axial localisation range make this approach suitable for many nanoscopic imaging applications.},

abstract ={Photo-activation localization microscopy is a far-field superresolution imaging technique based on the localization of single molecules with subdiffraction limit precision. Known under acronyms such as PALM (photo-activated localization microscopy) or STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy), these techniques achieve superresolution by allowing only a sparse, random set of molecules to emit light at any given time and subsequently localizing each molecule with great precision. Recently, such techniques have been extended to three dimensions, opening up unprecedented possibilities to explore the structure and function of cells. Interestingly, proper engineering of the three-dimensional (3D) point spread function (PSF) through additional optics has been demonstrated to theoretically improve 3D position estimation and ultimately resolution. In this paper, an optimal 3D single-molecule localization estimator is presented in a general framework for noisy, aberrated and/or engineered PSF imaging. To find the position of each molecule, a phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator is implemented. This estimator is shown to be efficient, meaning it reaches the fundamental CramerRao lower bound of x, y, and z localization precision. Experimental application of the phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator using a particular engineered PSF microscope demonstrates unmatched low-photon-count 3D wide-field single-molecule localization performance.},

abstract ={We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects, previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole approximation.},

abstract = {Background informationSingle molecule-based super-resolution methods have become important tools to study nanoscale structures in cell biology. However, the complexity of multi-colour applications has prevented them from being widely used amongst biologists. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) offers a simple way to perform single molecule super-resolution imaging without the need for an activator fluorophore and compatible with many conventionally used fluorophores. The search for the ideal dye pairs suitable for dual-colour dSTORM has been compromised by the fact that fluorophores spectrally apt for dual-colour imaging differ with respect to the optimal buffer conditions required for photoswitching and the generation of prolonged non-fluorescent (OFF) states.ResultsWe present a novel variant of dSTORM that combines advantages of spectral demixing with the buffer compatible blinking properties of red emitting carbocyanine dyes, spectral demixing dSTORM (SD-dSTORM). In contrast to previously published work, SD-dSTORM requires reduced laser power and fewer imaging frames for the faithful reconstruction of super-resolved biological nanostructures. In addition, SD-dSTORM allows the use of commercially available rather than custom-made probes and does not rely on potentially error-prone cross-talk correction, thus allowing reliable co-localisation.ConclusionsSD-dSTORM presents a significant advance towards user-friendly single molecule localisation-based super-resolution microscopy combining advantages of state-of-the-art methodologies to perform fast, reliable and efficient multi-colour dSTORM.},

A novel method for estimation of activity of the system was developed using a dissolved oxygen (DO) meter and an oxygen probe. The method can be used to determine the enzymatic activity of the system at GO concentrations of 0.005 to 0.030 unit/ml, with an r2 of 0.995 for the linearity of the standard curve, and can be adapted for analysis in any solution. At room temperature of 23.0  2.0C, the maximum activity of the BDG-GO-CAT system was found to occur at pH 5.40. The half-life values for the stability of GO-CAT in 0.10 M phosphate buffer solutions of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 were 9.78, 49.43, 53.46, 36.51, 12.68, 1.84, and 0.80 weeks, respectively. Dextrose was used in place of -D(+) glucose for cost-saving purposes, and a standard curve for the activity of GO-CAT was obtained using 20 mg/ml dextrose. The BDG-GO-CAT was effective as a DO scavenger in closed containers, when the containers were opened and exposed to atmosphere for 2 days between tests, and upon reclosing them. Pharmaceutical excipients such as ethanol, glycerin, propylene glycol, methylparaben, propylparaben, artificial strawberry flavor, and sodium benzoate did not show any adverse effect on the activity of BDG-GO-CAT. Sorbitol, high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and polyethylene glycol 3350 increased the rate of DO removal. Sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) at 2.0% w/v decreased the rate of DO removal. These studies indicate that the BDG(dextrose)-GO-CAT system warrants serious consideration for use an antioxidant system in aqueous formulations.},

The method consists of recording thousands of single-molecule trajectories that appear sequentially on a cell surface upon continuously labeling molecules of interest. It allows studying any molecules that can be labeled with fluorescent ligands including endogenous membrane proteins on livingcells. This approach, named universal PAINT (uPAINT), generalizes the previously developed point-accumulation-for-imaging-in-nanoscale-topography (PAINT) method for dynamicimaging of arbitrary membrane biomolecules. We show here that the unprecedented large statistics obtained by uPAINT on single cells reveal local diffusion properties of specific proteins, either in distinct membrane compartments of adherent cells or in neuronal synapses.},

abstract = {Cy5 is one of a few commercially available dyes in the near-infrared wavelength range. In this study, the fluorescence fluctuations of Cy5 have been investigated under steady-state excitation conditions by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The fluctuations in fluorescence are compatible with and can be used to characterize the photoinduced isomerization and back-isomerization, as well as the transitions between the singlet and triplet states of the dye. By employing a simple kinetic model, the rate constants of these processes can be determined. The model was used over a broad range of experimental conditions, where the influence on the isomerization properties of solvent viscosity, polarity, and temperature, excitation intensity and wavelength, and the presence of different side groups was investigated. We propose FCS as a useful and simple complementary approach to study isomerization processes of cyanine dyes yielding information about the rates of both the photoinduced isomerization and the back-isomerization, as well as of the kinetic properties of the triplet states. Our data show that for most excitation conditions relevant for ultrasensitive fluorescence spectroscopy a photostationary equilibrium is established between the isomeric forms, where approximately 50% of the Cy5 dye molecules can be expected to be in their weakly fluorescent cis states. The fluorophores therefore lose about half of their fluorescence capacity. This is of relevance for the performance of the dye in all applications of fluorescence spectroscopy where a high sensitivity or a fast readout is required, such as in single-molecule detection experiments and in many applications of confocal laser scanning microscopy.},

abstract = {We report on the strong polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence on single gold nanorods. The fluorescence from the organic fluorophores that are embedded in a mesostructured silica shell around individual gold nanorods is enhanced by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the nanorods. Our electrostatic calculations show that under an off-resonance excitation, the electric field intensity contour around a nanorod rotates away from the length axis as the excitation polarization is varied. The polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence is ascribed to the dependence of the averaged electric field intensity enhancement within the silica shell on the excitation polarization. The measured fluorescence enhancement factor is in very good agreement with that obtained from the electrostatic calculations. The fluorescence enhancement factor increases as the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is synthetically tuned close to the excitation wavelength. In addition, the polarization dependence is used to determine the orientation angle of the gold nanorods. The results are in excellent agreement with the actual measurements. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of the fluorophore is modified by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the gold nanorods. A linear correlation between the emission peak wavelength and the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is obtained.},

Biotinbinding increases the midpoint of temperature Tm of thermally induced denaturation of STV and AVD in phosphate buffer from 75 and 83C to 112 and 117C at full biotin saturation, respectively. This thermostability is the highest reported for proteins coming from either mesophilic or thermophilic organisms. In both proteins, biotin also increases the calorimetric enthalpy and the cooperativity of the unfolding. Thermalstability of STV was also evaluated in the presence of high concentrations of urea or guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl). In 6 M GuHCl, STV remains as a tetramer and the Tm of the STV-biotin complex is centered at 108C, a few degrees below the value obtained in phosphate buffer. On the contrary, STV under fully saturating condition remains mainly in its dimeric form in 8 M urea and the thermogram shows two endotherms. The main endotherm at a lower temperature has been ascribed to the dimeric liganded state with a Tm of 87C, and the higher temperature endotherm to the tetrameric liganded form with a Tm of 106C. As the thermostability of unliganded protein in the presence of urea is unchanged upon binding we related the extremelyhighthermalstability of this protein to both an increase in structural ordering and compactness with the preservation of the tetramer integrity.},

The simultaneous 2-fold improvement in the radial direction rendered a nearly spherical fluorescence spot with a diameter of 90110 nm.
