/** ComputationWay for joint (non-disjoint) computing on a plane.
 *  Joint computation is always possible and makes no assumptions about
 *  the layout of data points. However, it is also slower and less accurate
 *  than disjoint computation. The two parameters for joint computation
 *  are treated equally.
 *
 *  \tparam _ChunkSize The number of data points to be computed parallely.
 *                     Parallel computation allows the Eigen library to use
 *                     SSE and other processor features, but also forces the
 *                     data to be padded to appropriate size.
